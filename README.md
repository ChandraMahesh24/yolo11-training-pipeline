# yolo11-training-pipeline
A custom YOLOv11 training pipeline using Roboflow and Ultralytics, with advanced training, augmentation, validation, visualization, and ONNX export support.

# YOLOv11 Training Pipeline 🚀

This repository provides a full training pipeline for a custom object detection model architecture called **YOLOv11**, based on [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). It supports advanced configuration, Roboflow dataset integration, model evaluation, training visualization, and model export (ONNX).

> **Note:** YOLOv11 is a custom architecture. If you're using official Ultralytics models like `yolov8n.pt`, rename accordingly. This repo assumes `yolo11n.pt` or other YOLOv11 variants are available.
